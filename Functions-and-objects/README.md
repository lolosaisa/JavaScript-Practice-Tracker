# Functions and Objects

This folder focuses on two fundamental concepts in JavaScript: **Functions** and **Objects**. These are essential building blocks of the language, forming the backbone of many JavaScript applications.

---

Functions are the major building blocks in Javascript
They work by taking input/arguments and they optionally return a value that can be used else where in the code.

Objects - They contain a collection of key value pairs. Keys are the properties and values are the data or functions. They are used to store and group related data and functionalities.

## üìö Topics Covered

### Functions
- **Functions Basics** :
- **Function Basics**:
  - Function declaration
  - Function expression
  - Arrow functions (`=>`)
  - Anonymous functions
- **Parameters and Arguments**:
  - Default parameters
  - Rest parameters (`...args`)
  - Argument destructuring
- **Scope and Closures**:
  - Local vs global scope
  - Lexical scoping
  - Understanding closures and practical use cases
- **Higher-Order Functions**:
  - Functions as arguments
  - Returning functions
  - Built-in higher-order methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`)
- **`this` Keyword**:
  - Context in functions
  - Arrow functions vs regular functions
- **Function Methods**:
  - `call`, `apply`, and `bind`

### **Objects**
- **Object Basics**:
  - Creating objects (object literal, `Object.create`, and constructors)
  - Accessing and modifying properties (`dot` vs `bracket` notation)
- **Methods**:
  - Adding and calling methods in objects
  - `this` in the context of an object
- **Object Operations**:
  - Adding, updating, and deleting properties
  - Iterating over objects (`for...in`, `Object.keys`, `Object.entries`)
- **Object Destructuring**:
  - Extracting values from objects
  - Renaming during destructuring
  - Default values
- **Prototypes and Inheritance**:
  - Understanding the prototype chain
  - Creating prototypes and inheritance with `Object.create` and classes
- **Object-Oriented Programming**:
  - Classes and constructors
  - Encapsulation and methods
  - Static methods and properties
